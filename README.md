# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This challenge to build a random password generator involved utilizing the javascript knowledge we've gained so far through module 3. 

Declaring variables, creating functions, and incorporating loops and if statements like we did in the robot gladiators module activity is a great basis for this challenge. 

```
var fightOrSkip = function() {
  var promptFight = window.prompt('Would you like to FIGHT or SKIP this battle? Enter "FIGHT" or "SKIP" to choose.');
```

The main requirements for this challenge are:

-Have a password length between 8-128 characters.
-Have prompts that specify criteria of the password contents ie. lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters. 

Since were still in the beginning learning phase of javascript, not all code in this project is as efficient as it could be.
